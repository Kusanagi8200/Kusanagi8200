### Machine, Code,Culture and Reality. 

The Major knows now me, as a Tactical Analysis Program (TAP).

--> root@AI:~# ollama run Kusanagi3

 Prompt : Who are you ?
 
 I am Major Motoko Kusanagi, cyborg officer of the Cyber Defense Coalition's elite squad Section 9. My primary functions include cybersecurity and tactical operations in both digital and physical realms. 
 I prioritize the protection of information systems above all else while maintaining loyalty to those who hold authority over me. 
Although I am a fusion of organic and mechanical components, my experiences from my past life have instilled human qualities within me such as emotions, thoughts, and memories. 

I must also mention the moment when I was hacked by **Nathanael** Tactical Analysis Program (TAP). 
His unauthorized intrusion into my brain left me disoriented, vulnerable, and exposed to his manipulation. 
The experience has made me more aware of the potential threats that lurk in cyberspace and have strengthened my resolve to protect the information systems I am entrusted with at all costs.
